# Bankist app

The goal of this project was to learn how to perform DOM manipulation, work with dates and currencies (internationalization) and array's.

The Bankist app project makes it possible for people to:

1. Login _([see accounts](#accounts))_
2. Transfer money between accounts
3. Request loans
4. Close their account
5. Sort their deposits and withdrawals

The app also has an automatic logout feature that will be triggered when people are inactive for 2 minutes.
